# React Fundamental-Blog Project (Final Version)

## Overview
This is a simple React-based blogging platform that demonstrates CRUD operations. The application allows users to create, read, and delete blog posts. It uses **React Router** for navigation, **React Icons** for UI elements, and a custom **useFetch** hook to fetch data from a JSON server.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Displays all blogs fetched from a JSON server.
- **Create Blog**: Form to create a new blog post with title, body, and author.
- **View Blog Details**: Detailed view of a specific blog.
- **Delete Blog**: Remove a blog post from the database.
- **404 Page**: Custom page for undefined routes.

## Purpose

The app demonstrates the implementation of various React concepts, including:
 
- Navigating between pages using **React Router**
- Working with dynamic routes and **URL Parameters**
- Fetching data from APIs using **fetch API**
- Creating reusable **Custom Hooks** like `useFetch`
- Performing **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Delete)
- Managing side effects with the **useEffect Hook**
- Using conditional rendering for dynamic UI updates
- Building and handling **Forms** for user input using controlled inputs
- Leveraging **React Icons** for UI enhancements
- Using JSON Server(for testing APIs)

## Usage
### Creating a Blog Post
1. Navigate to the **Add Blog** page.
2. Fill out the form fields (title, body, author) and submit.
3. The blog post will appear on the Home page.

### Viewing Blog Details
- Click on a blog card to view its details.

### Deleting a Blog Post
- In the blog details view, click the delete button to remove the blog.

## Custom Hook: `useFetch`
The custom `useFetch` hook is used to fetch data from an API. It supports aborting fetch requests to avoid memory leaks.

```javascript
const { data, isLoaded, error } = useFetch("http://localhost:8000/blogs");
```

## Style

The project uses a responsive design with modern CSS styling. Fonts are imported from Google Fonts, and a warm orange theme is used for highlights.
